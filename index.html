            <h3>About this language:</h3>
            <p>A new language, by Aarooshcoding33. Genre of this is exploring. This explorer language's difficulty is kind of hard. But not the absolute level of hardness. Remember, this is a Pre-Alpha version which is a VERY early version of the new language. More syntaxes are coming out soon! When more sytaxes come out, update the software. The present syntaxes are given below. And SemiColon (;) must be placed after each line.</p>

        <div class="installation">
            <h3>Installation:</h3>

            <p>Sorry, iOS is only available right now due to the Alpha version.</p>

    <div class="syntaxes">
        <h1>-- (For small comments) # (For large comments)</h1>
        <h2>Everytime you need to use getup(); or else, the character will sleep. (STARTS BY LAYING IN BED)</h2>
        <p>talk(string); or me.talk(string); ↔️ You talk (if you only use talk(); it is automatically guessed as you (me))</p>
        <p>walkto(individual (MUST BE ALL CHARACTERS CAPITALIZED)); and runto(individual (MUST BE ALL CHARACTERS CAPITALIZED)); ↔️ Self explanation, individuals = mom, dad, me</p>
        <p>showcurrent.item(); -- Shows the current thing like time.</p>
        <h1>No variables here and no conditions. start: and :end must be in the program or the program won't run.</h1>
        <p>cry(time (optional)); or individual.cry(time (optional));</p>
        <p>wait(time); or wait.life(time); -- Self explanation</p>
        <p>update individual (individual is optional but if it is a lot of individuals, it is not optional) {  }; -- Updates an individual if there is no individual, it will be automatically me.</p>
        <p><h1>Conditions but not conditions</h1>Conditions here are complex. Syntax will be coming later.</p>
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>To start a loop, type the following code.</p>
        <p>loop(number) { your program };</p>
        <p><h2>Imports</h2>To import, type "from life import module;". You can also use "from life import module as name;". If you want to do shortcut, type "import module;"</p>
        <h2>Module names (Pre-Alpha):</h2>
        <p>killperson (kp)</p>
        <p>Use: This actually stops the individual not kill the individual. "individual.kp();"</p>
        <p>teleportperson (tp) (YOU MUST USE THE "from life import tp; YOU CANNOT USE SHORTCUT HERE.") -- Self explanation</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The installation isn't available currently, but will be in the future.</h2>
        <p>Reason: Making the Life language.</p>

        <div class="error-syntaxes">
            <h2>Error syntaxes:</h2>
            <p>You cannot put individual "ME" in runto(); or walkto(); or the code will bug out. And the ME character will run or walk infinitely in a single place. It will be like, it is moon running or moon walking. Same to teleportperson, because, it will infinitely teleport to the character itself. Other codes won't work.</p>
